# **Apache Log File Regex Project**

## **Overview**

The Apache Log File Regex Project is a Ruby-based utility designed to parse and extract specific information from Apache log files. This tool empowers users to efficiently analyze Apache log data and extract valuable insights, such as IP addresses, timestamps, HTTP methods, status codes, and more.

## **Features**

- **Flexible Log Data Extraction**: Extract various log data elements, including IP addresses, timestamps, HTTP methods, status codes, and more, using regular expressions.
- **Interactive User Interface**: User-friendly command-line interface that allows you to specify the log file and the type of data to extract.
- **Data Viewing and Export**: Choose to either view extracted data directly on the console or save it to a file for further analysis.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures graceful handling of missing or inaccessible log files.

## **Requirements**

- Ruby 2.5+ installed on your system.
